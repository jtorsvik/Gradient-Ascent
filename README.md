# Gradient-Ascent

This is optional coursework from the class in Mathematics and Computation Methods for Complex Systems (MCMCS) at the University of Sussex.

Parts of the code is built by Professor Luc Berthouze with gaps in the code that is filled by the student (me, Joakim Torsvik)

The two models display gradient ascent in different environments (one simple, and another complex).

The model implements Early Stopping when maximum height. However, the model can still be improved in order to better locate the global maximum.
